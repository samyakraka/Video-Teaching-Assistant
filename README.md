# Video Teaching Assistant

The **Video Teaching Assistant** is a Flask-based web application that provides an interactive interface for video streaming, image capture, audio recording, and language translation. It uses AI-based tools for transcription, translation, and response generation, making it a valuable tool for teaching and learning.

---

## Features

- **Live Video Streaming**: Streams video feed from a connected camera.
- **Image Capture**: Captures images from the video feed for analysis or teaching purposes.
- **Audio Recording**: Records audio for transcription and response generation.
- **AI-Powered Response Generation**: Processes captured images and recorded audio to generate intelligent responses.
- **Language Translation**: Translates responses into multiple languages with audio playback support.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive interface for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML5** and **CSS3**: For structuring and styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality and event handling.

### Backend
- **Flask**: As the web framework for handling routes and backend logic.
- **OpenCV**: For video streaming and image processing.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For transcribing recorded audio.
- **Google Generative AI**: For response generation and translation.
- **gTTS**: For converting text into speech.

### Miscellaneous
- **Pyaudio**: For recording audio.
- **Wave**: For handling audio file formats.
- **Google Cloud Services**: For translations and AI responses.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing.
